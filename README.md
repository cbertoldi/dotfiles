My configuration files. Feel free to use them, fork them, blame them.

I copied, and modified some parts of [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).
Looking at others dotfiles projects, I understood that my environment is
simply ugly. So, I'll try to improve it.
